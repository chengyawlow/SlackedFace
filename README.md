## Supplementary Materials

We provide supplementary materials to enhance the understanding and insights into our work, including: <br>
+  Theoretical Analysis
+  Benchmarking Datasets
+  Hyperparameter Analysis and Configuration
+  Stability Analysis
+  Model Extension

## Implementation Materials

For reproducibility purposes, the distractor sets (with 10K and 20K of low-resolution face images) sampled from that of TinyFace are downloaded from the following links:
+  [TinyFace Distractor Subset - 10K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fFBPODGQuGVBzGCLfBu7V123XnQdn0zJ/view?usp=drive_link)
+  [TinyFace Distractor Subset - 20K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pmASrQvTWu7VDoW4VQtbs1T1AG8Apw9F/view?usp=drive_link)

The complete distractor set is available at the [TinyFace Official Portal](https://qmul-tinyface.github.io/). 

Other materials will be shared upon acceptance of this paper. 

## Extended Experimental Results 

We will provide additional experimental results for high-resolution/mixed-resolution face recognition.
